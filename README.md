This project shows how to build a digital clock with **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. 

This is how it should look like:

The repository contains 3 main files: *index.html, main.css, and main.js*. Adding extensions such as a live server comes in handy with a preview of the pages. For making a digital clock, I used the main container. The main part of the project, displaying the hours, minutes, and seconds, was done using the *getElementId()*. To get the exact time, we defined the function clock time, and inside that function initialized 4 main variables, where in each, we stored the specific value. Inside the if - statement, it has been shown how we can get information on the hours, minutes, and seconds. 

> NOTE:  The project doesn't contain information about the day, month, and title. That step can be added after it.
